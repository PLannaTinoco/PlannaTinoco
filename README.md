### About me
![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=anuraghazra&hide_progress=true)


Currently residing in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil, I am in my third semester pursuing a degree in Computer Science at PUC Minas. I possess a foundational understanding of programming languages such as C, C++, Java, and have experience in both Front-end and Back-end development.

Throughout my initial academic period, I actively engaged in team projects at the university, collaborating with two peers on initiatives that required effective communication and cooperation. Additionally, I delved into the field of Machine Learning using the Orange software, undertaking an individual project on the subject.

My dedication to studies and continual pursuit of improvement is reflected in my ability to solve logical problems related to programming. I communicate effectively and maintain a committed stance, always striving to perform tasks to the best of my ability. I am open to new learning opportunities and challenges, ready to make a meaningful contribution in collaborative environments, and eager to broaden my expertise in the field of Computer Science.
